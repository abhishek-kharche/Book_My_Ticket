Technologies Used:- HTML, JSP, JavaScritpt, MS Access
(Note: This project is not hosted on internet)

This project was successfully completed in third year of undergraduate degree in the team
strength of 3 people. The objective of project was to make a website similar to travel
agency which has ability to book the tour packages online. The registration form and
password recovery was also implemented in the project along with database connectivity to
store user's information.

The website can be viewed just by opening intro.html in the browser. Whereas one could not
register to the website as it is not hosted and to do it locally one has to install and
set up Apache tomcat.

BookMyTicket contains several webpages for India tours, world tours, special packages,
privacy policy, registration etc. Sample view of these pages is shown in "Sample run.pdf"
